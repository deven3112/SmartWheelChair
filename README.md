# Smart Wheelchair for Paralysis Patients

This project aims to develop a smart wheelchair designed for paralysis patients, providing multiple control mechanisms to cater to different needs and abilities. The wheelchair can be controlled using a flex sensor, a joystick, or a hall effect sensor.

## Features

- **Flex Sensor Controlled Wheelchair**
- **Joystick Controlled Wheelchair**
- **Hall Effect Sensor Controlled Wheelchair**

## Flex Sensor Controlled Wheelchair

The flex sensor allows the wheelchair to be controlled by bending the sensor, translating physical flexion into directional movement.

### Components

- Flex sensor
- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino)
- Motor drivers
- Wheelchair motors
- Power supply

## Joystick Controlled Wheelchair

The joystick control mechanism enables the user to navigate the wheelchair by moving the joystick in the desired direction.

### Components

- Joystick module
- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino)
- Motor drivers
- Wheelchair motors
- Power supply

## Hall Effect Sensor Controlled Wheelchair

The hall effect sensor control allows the wheelchair to be directed using magnetic fields, providing a touchless control option.

### Components

- Hall effect sensor
- Magnet
- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino)
- Motor drivers
- Wheelchair motors
- Power supply

## Installation

1. Assemble the wheelchair components based on the chosen control mechanism.
2. Connect the sensors and actuators to the microcontroller.
3. Upload the respective code to the microcontroller.
4. Test the system to ensure proper functionality.

## Usage

1. Power on the wheelchair.
2. Use the selected control mechanism (flex sensor, joystick, or hall effect sensor) to navigate the wheelchair.
3. Adjust sensitivity and response as needed for user comfort.
